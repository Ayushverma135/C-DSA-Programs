# C_PROGRAMS

This repository contains a collection of C programs related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts through practical implementation in the C programming language. The programs cover a wide range of topics including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more. Each program is meticulously crafted to demonstrate the underlying DSA principles, with clear and concise code accompanied by explanatory comments where necessary. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp fundamental concepts or an experienced programmer aiming to reinforce your skills, this repository offers a valuable resource for both learning and reference. Contributions are welcome, whether it be adding new programs, optimizing existing ones, or suggesting improvements. This repository is distributed under the [insert_license_here] license, granting users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code for both educational and commercial purposes. For any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to the repository maintainers. Happy coding!
